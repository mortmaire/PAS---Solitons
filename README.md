# Polish Academy of Science - Symulation of Bose-Einstein gas and solitons counting method

My project made in collaboration with Quantum Optics group in PAS. The main goal were to prepare fine method of counting stable structures in quantum-mechanics simulation. This is going to be the last report, after this project we start exploration of quite different field (but still numerical simulations).
